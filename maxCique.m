function clique = maxClique(m)
%myFun - Description
%
% Syntax: clique = maxClique(m)
% m is a adjacency matrix
% maxClique aims to find out the max connected clique
%    eg:consider a group of people, the relations between them can be presented as an adjecency matrix
%       m(i,j) = 1; stands for ith person know the jth person
%       and maxClique can find the max group in which people know each other,
%       store the group info in the variance-clique
%       this is a np-complete question, only request a solution close to optimal
